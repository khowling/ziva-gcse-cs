# TODO: Create a function, pilotValid(), that:
# • takes a pilot code as a parameter
# • uses the 2D array journeys to calculate the number of hours that the pilot has flown
# • returns valid if the pilot has flown 9 hours or fewer or warning if the pilot has flown for more than 9 hours
# • uses casting where needed

# Nummbers is an array of 100 elements, each initialized to an empty string
numbers = [''] * 100


# TODO Write an algorithm for player A's turn, which;
#  * takes as an input the number that player A chooses
#  * if it has not already been chosen, stores an “A” in that array element
#  * if it has already been chosen, outputs “taken“
#  * counts and outputs the quantity of numbers left that have not been chosen
